<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Dylan — I build stuff. I break stuff. Then I fix it better.<br />
Currently working my way through full-stack development while sharpening my ethical hacking skills.<br />
For me, coding is about creating something that works beautifully — and hacking is about understanding<br />
how it really works.<br />
Every project is a step closer to my goal:<br />
becoming unstoppable in both building and securing digital systems.<br />
When I'm not coding or hunting bugs, you'll find me learning new tech,<br />
experimenting with projects, and pushing my skills to the next level.</p>
